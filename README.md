Our project: Learning how to properly use a graph database.

The objective of this project is uncover the strengths of a graph database over other types of dbs.
Steps:

1. Getting a dataset of your choice. 
2. Installing Neo4j.
3. Learning the basics of the cypher query language.
4. The data might be relational or in other formats, we might need to convert it into graph data.
5. Uncover insights about our data that might be very difficult to retrieve in other forms of dbs.
6. Choosing a project theme.

Note that we used the nodes and relations csv file but we removed the label column and the last 3 from the nodes csv and the first 2 and last columns from the relations. (either empty columns or same value)
